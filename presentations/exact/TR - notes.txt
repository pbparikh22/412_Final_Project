#Thomas Rothman NP Project notes

decision problem: does the graph G contain a path of k or more edges?

optimized problem: what is the longest path in graph G

problem input: 

why can't we inverse the weights and run shortest path?
	solution can be found in linear time if directed acyclic graph using inverse b/c guaranteed to have no negative cycles

show reduction of hamiltonian path to longest path
