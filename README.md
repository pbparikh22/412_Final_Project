Defining the Problem:  the longest path problem is NP-hard and the decision version of the problem, which asks whether a path exists of at least some given length, is NP-complete.
</p> 

<h3>Format Input:</h3>

<p>
The program takes in a directed graph and finds the longest path from a single node source<br>
this line contains number of vertices and number of lines to read<br>
the following lines contains the vertex, destination vertex, and edge weight<br>

3 3<br>
0 1 3<br>
1 2 3<br>
2 0 3<br>
