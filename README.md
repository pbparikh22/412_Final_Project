Defining the Problem:  the longest path problem is NP-hard and the decision version of the problem, which asks whether a path exists of at least some given length, is NP-complete. 

Format Input:

3 3     // this line contains number of vertices and number of lines to read
0 1 3   // these contains the vertex, destination vertex, and edge weight
1 2 3
